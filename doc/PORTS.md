# Ports

Ports in GLSP are a way to describe docking points for a graphical node element to connect edges. Ports are a concept of [Eclipse Sprotty](https://github.com/eclipse/sprotty) and are adapted by GLSP. Ports are optional. This means that if you do not define explicit ports you can connect an edge on any border of your graphical element.


If you have more complex model elements ports are a good solution to define where edges can be placed to connect your nodes.
