# The Open-BPMN Release Process

The release management process of Open-BPMN is based on the [Releasemanagement and versioning](https://github.com/imixs/imixs-workflow/wiki/Releasemanagement-and-versioning) of the Imixs Workflow main project. Because the project contains a Java part and JavaScript (Node.JS) part also the release process is split into two parts. The java part is based on the Maven Release Plugin, the JavaScript part is based on [nmp]((https://docs.npmjs.com/creating-and-publishing-scoped-public-packages).

## How to Release a new Version

A release can be performed by calling the script "release.sh". This script is as far as possible automated. It releases the current maven snapshots and publish the node.js modules into the [Open-BPMN nmp repository](https://www.npmjs.com/settings/open-bpmn/packages).

Before you start the release process verify if the general build of open-bpmn is successful:

    $ mvn clean install
    $ ./scripts/build.sh -i

Check current release status on npm:

https://www.npmjs.com/settings/open-bpmn/packages

To be able to publish to the npm repository (https://www.npmjs.com/) create frist an _automation token_ and set this token in your local environment first!

    $ cd open-bpmn.glsp-client/
    $ npm config set _authToken=%YOUR_ACCES_TOKEN%

Replace `%YOUR_ACCES_TOKEN%` with a valid Token!

As an alternative you can also do a local login against https://www.npmjs.com/ first

    $ npm login

Now you can run the release script:

    $ ./scripts/release.sh

Finally commit your changes.

### How to bump the pom version

If you not run the release script you can also bumping the version number of OpenBPMN using a script:

    $ changeVersion.sh <oldVersionString> <newVersionString>

Specify the old and the new version. Example:

    $ changeVersion.sh 0.3.0 0.4.0

Finally commit your changes.
