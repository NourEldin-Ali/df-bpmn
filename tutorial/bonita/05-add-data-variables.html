        <h3>Extract the data variable need to use in the implementation phase</h3>
        Based on the process description, you should be abel to extract the data variables need to use during the
        execution phase.
        There are two data types:
        <ol>
            <li>
                Business data: there are the data need to be stored within the database (BDM).
            </li>
            <li>
                Process variable: there are the data need to used during the execution of each process. These variables
                are used temporary during the execution. For example for get data from user and the do some mathematical
                function before save in the database. Also, can be used to add the condition on the gateways.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <br>

        <h3>How to add Business data and process variable?</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                To add data variables, you need to select the pool, and then within "Data" tab, select "pool variables", and then you can add Business variables (for BDM objects), and Process variables (used during the execution).

            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                To add a business data, after click on add in "Business variable", you can add name and the the Business
                Object (from the BDM object).

            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                To add a business variable, after click on add in "Process variable", you can add name and the the data
                type (Text, double, ...).
                <br>

            </li>

        </ol>
        <br>
        <br>

        <h3>Extract the mission data variable from the process description</h3>
        In the process description, you can find in <b>bold</b> the data variables need to be used during the execution
        phase. Also, in <i>italic</i> the attributes that used late in the implementation.
        However, there still missing one Business data. Please find it and add to to you process data.
        <br><br>
        A user fills a procurement <b>request</b> <i>(summary and description)</i> and identify a <i>supplier</i>. This
        <b>request</b> is sent to
        the <i>supplier</i> a quotation. The supplier should add the following information to the quotation: price, comments,
        if he is accept or no. The status of quotation will automatically changed to completed.
        After completed, the quotations are sent back to the requestor for review and selection. Before starting the
        review process, the <i>status</i> of the <b>request</b> will be changed to "pending for review". In the review
        quotation, the
        requestor should accept or reject the quotation. And finally based on the <b>decision of the requestor</b>, the
        <b>request</b>
        <i>status</i> changed to completed or abort.
        To effectively implement the process, developer must understand how the information is conceptually structured
        and arranged within each class (suppliers, quotation and request) and how the process interacts with it.
        <br>
        <br>
        Add the missing data variable to your process model.
