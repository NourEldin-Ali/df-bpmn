# The Open-BPMN Server

The server part of **Open BPMN** is build on the Eclipse GLSP Server technology. 

The server is responsible to translate a BPMN model into a GLSP Graph to be displayed by the client. The server communicates with the client via actions and events send from the client to the server and vice versa.
