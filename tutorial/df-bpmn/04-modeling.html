        <h2>BPMN to process model in the tool</h2>
        In this exercice, you need to create the BPMN model bellow in the DF-BPMN tool, including the data flow of each
        activity. In this exercice, we will start by explain where you can find the elements of the process model. Then,
        you should able to add activities and data within each activity.
        <br>
        <img src="../example/example-BPMN.png" align="middle" width="800" />
        <br>
        <br>
        <h3>DF-BPMN symbols</h3>
        <img src="04-modeling/01-df-bpmn-symbol.png" width="600" />
        <br><br>
        This symbols represent the data flow of each activity.<br>
        There are different data types:
        <ul>
            <li><b>Data object</b> there are the process variabels that used during the execution phase.</li>
            <li><b>Data store</b> there are the business data that used stored or retreived from the database (BDM
                within Bonita studio).</li>
            <li><b>Data user</b> there are the data need to read from the user to continue the activity tasks (Fill
                information from user to used within the process model).</li>
            <li><b>Data system</b> there are the data that read or send to a server system (Like, auto-sending email,
                auto check the calender).</li>
        </ul>
        The icon of the data object is to present the data types.<br>
        (a),(c), (e), (f) and (g) are input data where:
        <ul>
            <li>(a): is a simple data input. This input object has name, type, also can attached by attributes. The
                object type can be simple type like string, integer, ... or complex type like the UML object name
                (Request in this example).</li>
            <li>(c): is a multi-instance data input. This input object also has name, type, also can attached by
                attributes, But it use to present multi-instance object or list of oject from the same data type</li>
            <li>(e) and (f): are two data object depend on each other. if we have (e), it should be connected to (f).
                (e) used to indicate that we need data from a list of from the database. However, (f) is to present that
                the user need to select one (or more) object from the database.
            </li>
            <li>(g): is a static data input. This input object has name, type, and value. This data object is to present
                a fix value that we need to use within our model.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        (b), and (d) are output data where:
        <ul>
            <li>
                (b): is a simple data output object. This output object has name, type, also can attached by attributes,
                indeed to a state to present the opeartion on this object. The
                object type can be simple type like string, integer, ... or complex type like the UML object name
                (Request in this example).
                <br>
                State can be:
                <ol>
                    <li>init: for the creation of new data object.</li>
                    <li>read: for the read a data object.</li>
                    <li>delete: for the delete a data object.</li>
                    <li>update: for the update a data object.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>
                (d): is a multi-instance data output object. This output object has name, type, also can attached by
                attributes,
                indeed to a state to present the opeartion on this object.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        (h) : is the data processing operator that present the complex data operation like sum, conditions etc.
        <br>
        This operator is connected to the data input and data output object.
        <br>
        <br>
        (i): is the flow that connect the inputs by the outputs. Also we can connect the outputs by the outputs and
        connect the data operator to input and output.
        <br>
        <br>
        <h3>Pool and Lane</h3>
        <ol>
            After open your project (double click on project file name), you can start the modelling. You can find all
            the elements in "Palette".
            <li>
                From the "Palette", click on "Pool", and then click on the whitespace to add the pool.
                <br>
                <img src="04-modeling/02-add-pool.png" width="600" />
            </li>
            <li>
                Then, we should add the lane of our process model. We can do that by click on "Lane" (find it in the
                "palette") and then click on
                the name of the "name of your pool to add new lane.
                <br>
                <img src="04-modeling/03-add-lane.png" width="600" />
            </li>
            <li>
                Then, to change the Pool name, click on the pool (on pool name), then, you should open the panel
                properties, then in
                "General" tab, you can change the name of your pool.
                <br>
                <img src="04-modeling/04-change-pool-name.png" width="600" />
            </li>
            <li>
                Then, to change the Lane name, click on the pool (on pool name), then, you should open the panel
                properties, then in
                "Lanes" tab, you can change the name of your lanes (it is a list of all your lanes in the selected
                pool).
                <br>
                <img src="04-modeling/05-change-lane-name.png" width="600" />
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Add Process Model Elements</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                You can find all the process elements in the "palette". In the DF-BPMN tool, we propose to add an
                activity and
                then add directly the data element of it. This helpfull for reducing the time of expanding the activity.
                <br>
                <img src="04-modeling/06-process-element.png" width="200" />
            </li>
            <li>
                From the property panel, you can change the name of the activity, also you can expand and collapse an
                activity.
                <br>
                <img src="04-modeling/08-activitypanel.png" width="600" />
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Add data within the activity</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Before adding the data to the activity, make sure that the activity is expanded. Then, you can change
                the size of it based on your needs.
                <br>
                <img src="04-modeling/08-activitypanel.png" width="600" />
            </li>
            <li>
                All the data can be found within the panel. You can select the data object you need and then add to the
                activity.
                <br>
                <img src="04-modeling/07-data-element.png" width="200" />
            </li>
            <li>
                you can change the name of the data object from the property panel, also you can change the type, and
                the state in case of output object.
                <br>
                <img src="04-modeling/09-data-panel.png" width="600" />
            </li>

            <li>
                In other case (is not included in this example), you can add the data processing operator. this operator
                is to define a specific data operations like sum,....
                <br>
                Todo that, after add the data processing operator, and connect it to the data object inputs and outputs,
                you should add the description of the operator, by open the property panel, and then within the
                documents you can add the description using your own world.
                Following by click on the "Generate Behavior". To express the data operations in other language (after
                few seconds), that used late to be code in the next exercice.
                <br>
                <img src="04-modeling/09-gherkin.png" width="600" />
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Add data to the following activtiy</h3>
        In this exercice, you need to create a process model using DF-BPMN tool, also to add the data of
        each activity.
        You have some hints for the activities you want to create, dont forget to add sequence flow between activities.
        <br>
        <h4>Process description</h4>
        A user fills a procurement request (summary and description) and identify a supplier. This request is sent to
        the supplier for quotation. The supplier should add the following inforamtion to the quotation: price, comments,
        if he is accept or no. The status of quotation will automatically changed to completed.
        After completed, the quotations are sent back to the requestor for review and selection. Before starting the
        review process, the status of the request will be changed to "pending for review". In the review quotation, the
        requestor should accept or reject the quotation. And finally based on the decision of the requestor, the request
        status changed to completed or abort.
        To effectively implement the process, developer must understand how the information is conceptually structured
        and arranged within each class (suppliers, quotation and request) and how the process interacts with it.
        <br>
        <br>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <b>Activity "Create request and select supplier"</b>
                <br>
                We have in this activity 2 main object that we need to create
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Request within the summary nad the description.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Quotation within the create request and selected supplier
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            Therefore, we need to get the information of the request from the user, also the supplier should be selected
            from the database before create the new quotation.
            <br>
            This activity with the data is the activity that express all this information. Please add it to your process
            model.
            <br>
            <img src="04-modeling/10-create-request.png" width="500" />
            <li>
                <b>Activity "Complete quotation"</b>
                <br>
                In this activity, the supplier (presented by the lane) should add the informations about the quotation,
                which
                means that this activity is to update the quotation that created in the first activity.
                <br>
                From the process description, find the data object of this activity.
                <br>
                Note: in the first activity you define "quotation" you should use the same name of the data object in
                all the process model to refere the same data object.
                <br>
                Hint: in this activity, you have 3 data user inputs and on static input, and you have one data object
                output with 4 attributes.
                <br>
                Add the data within this activity in you model.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                <b>Activity "Update request status"</b>
                <br>
                Add this activity after extract the data information from the process description.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Activity "Review quotation"</b>
                <br>
                After this activity, there is a gateway, therefore, we can add a process variable to use it late in take
                a dicision after the gateway.
                <br>
                This activity can be modeled in two way:
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        This first way is only to review the request and update if it accepted or not. Then, use the
                        request attribute (isAccepted) to take a decision.
                        <br>
                        <img src="04-modeling/16-review-quotation.png" width="500" />
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        In other way, we can define the process variable, which will be used later in the gateway and
                        then update the request if it acceted or not.
                        <br>
                        <img src="04-modeling/17-review-quotation2.png" width="500" />
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <br>
                Add this activity to your model.
                <br>
                Note: You should always use the same name of the data that you are used before "request".
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                <b>Activity "Complete request"</b>
                <br>
                Add this activity, and extract the data information from the process description.
                <br>
                Note: You should always use the same name of the data that you are used before.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                <b>Activity "Abort request"</b>
                <br>
                Add this activity, and extract the data information from the process description.
                <br>
                Note: You should always use the same name of the data that you are used before.
            </li>
            <br>
        </ol>
        <br>
        At the final of this excercice, you should have all the activity illustrated in the process model (BPMN to
        DF-BPMN tool), indeed, to the data operations within each activity.
