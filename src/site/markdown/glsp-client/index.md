# The Open-BPMN Client

The client part of **Open BPMN** is build on the Eclipse GLSP Client technology. 

The client is responsible to display the BPMN model in a diagram plane and provide tools to create, modify and delete BPMN elements.  
The client communicates with the server via actions and events send from the client to the server and vice versa.
